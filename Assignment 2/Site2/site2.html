				<li> IP routing is the routing of IP packets through networks. This involves routing packets through routers/switches on various networks to the packet's destination network. Each router/switch will determine how to route the packet based on its routing table and the packet's destination address which is located in the header of each packet. </li> 
				<li> Name based routing is a theoretical concept of routing based on domain names, similar to IP routing but with domain names. In reality, the DNS will resolve each domain name to an IP address before sending any other IP network packets. </li> 
				<li> Apache directives are configuration settings for the apache server that are set in the httpd configuration file. Based on the configuration, different aspects of the server will change such as the Apache listening port. </li>
